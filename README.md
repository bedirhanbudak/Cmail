# Confirmed Mail

Confirmed Mail is a mail confirmation application.

## Description

Cmail (Confirmed Mail) is basically a mail security application that protects you against phishing attacks by confirming that incoming mail comes from the original source.

## How Cmail Works?

Cmail seeks user’s mail address to check if new mail has arrived. If user receives a new mail, Cmail instantly sends a response mail to the owner of the incoming mail. This response mail contains an information text and a unique code.

Once the sender replies the response mail with the unique code, Cmail checks this reply and if the confirmation code in the reply matches the original code, it marks the first incoming mail and thus this mail is confirmed and called "Confirmed Mail".

## Simple Guide:

* **Auto delete info mail:** If you enable it, incoming information mails will be deleted after reading.
